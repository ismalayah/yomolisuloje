In May 2019, during an appearance on "Live with Kelly and Ryan," the "Pokémon: Detective Pikachu" actor talked about his daughters and revealed that Inez is a fan of villains. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLcM4PoEZhw">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"She's super into villains. We watch Beauty and the Beast, and her favorite character is Gaston."</p><p class=dh>The doting dad also mentioned how the 5-year-old's doctor caught on to her pull to the "dark side." When their pediatrician met Inez, she said the little one was "shady." Reynolds agreed and recounted one day at the airport on their way home when a funny situation unfolded. Inez, only two years old at the time, got selected for a secondary security pat down, and she took it in stride as Ryan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLcM4PoEZhw">joked</a>, "She just takes it like a hard-earned felon."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Inez Has a Sense of Style</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In mid-2021, Inez's mother shared a photo of her dressed in a pink and white outfit.

Blake captioned the post by saying she was trying to get her 4-year-old dressed at 5 a.m., but she insisted on dressing her instead. It seems <a class="me a" href=#>Blake Lively</a>'s daughter has a sense of style, and the "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" actress is enjoying all the fun and memorable moments with her little one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbmhlaHqqusSzZKudqaO8rbDSZqOio5Woeq671aKcZq6Zobmitc2sZG5llpbAb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f295053-inez-reynolds-likes-movie-villains-5-fas-html.html&text=Inez%20Reynolds%20Likes%20Movie%20Villains%20-%205%20Fast%20Facts%20about%20Blake%20Livelys%20Daughter%20with%20Ryan%20Reynolds&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f295053-inez-reynolds-likes-movie-villains-5-fas-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f295053-inez-reynolds-likes-movie-villains-5-fas-html.html&title=Inez%20Reynolds%20Likes%20Movie%20Villains%20-%205%20Fast%20Facts%20about%20Blake%20Livelys%20Daughter%20with%20Ryan%20Reynolds" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f295053-inez-reynolds-likes-movie-villains-5-fas-html.html&title=Inez%20Reynolds%20Likes%20Movie%20Villains%20-%205%20Fast%20Facts%20about%20Blake%20Livelys%20Daughter%20with%20Ryan%20Reynolds" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f295053-inez-reynolds-likes-movie-villains-5-fas-html.html&title=Inez%20Reynolds%20Likes%20Movie%20Villains%20-%205%20Fast%20Facts%20about%20Blake%20Livelys%20Daughter%20with%20Ryan%20Reynolds" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f295053-inez-reynolds-likes-movie-villains-5-fas-html.html&description=Inez%20Reynolds%20Likes%20Movie%20Villains%20-%205%20Fast%20Facts%20about%20Blake%20Livelys%20Daughter%20with%20Ryan%20Reynolds" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-best-letitia-wright-movies-and-tv-shows-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 best Letitia Wright movies and TV shows, ranked">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bill-nye-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bill Nye Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
