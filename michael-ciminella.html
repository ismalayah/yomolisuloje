Inc. He was also a former freelance remote sports producer at ESPN, CBC, and so on.</p><p>However, Ciminella is mostly recognized for his marriage with the late country singer Naomi Judd. The former pair had a rocky relationship filled with drama and suspense. Let's find out about it as we explore the life of Judd's first spouse Michael.</p><h2>Michael Ciminella Married Life With Naomi Judd</h2><p>Michael Ciminella and Naomi Judd stayed married for 8 years. The <i>Love Can Build A Bridge </i>singer had just turned 18 when she exchanged the vows with Ciminella.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/6/Naomi%20Judd%20married%20Larry%20Strickland%20after%20divorce%20with%20Michael%20Ciminella-1701851859719.jpg><p>The former pair Naomi and Michael were high school sweethearts and classmates. Ciminella also became the first husband of Judd after the intimate wedding ceremony in 1964.</p><p>However, Ciminella and Judd's relationship ended in 1972. Their divorce was due to Naomi's infidelity.</p><h2>Naomi Judd tricked Michael Ciminella</h2><p>Did you know? Naomi Judd tricked her first husband Michael Ciminella by telling <strong>Wynonna Judd</strong> as his daughter. According to Michael, the American singer came to him and said she was pregnant with their child.</p><p>Ciminella believed it and decided to marry Naomi. But it was all the web of lies Judd created. Michael knew Wynonna was not her daughter when she was 3. He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>;&nbsp;</p><p>"I just looked at her real carefully, and I knew,"</p><h2>Who Is Wynonna Judd Biological Father?</h2><p>For years, Wynonna Judd believed Michael Ciminella was her biological father. Eventually, Naomi Judd later confessed about this to her daughter. When the American singer, Wynonna confronted her mother about it Naomi said she was afraid she would throw her out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/6/Wynonna%20Judd's%20biological%20father%20Charles%20Jordan-1701851989572.jpg"><p>Wynonna's biological father is Charles Jordan who was Naomi's ex. Ciminella did not know his girl was also sleeping with him. The <i>Why Not Me </i>singer's father died in 2000.</p><h2>Michael Ciminella's Biological Daughter</h2><p>The only biological daughter of Michael Ciminella is <a href=#><strong>Ashley Judd</strong></a>. Ashley was born in 1968 in Granada Hills, Los Angeles. Michael's daughter was just four years old when her parents separated.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Naomi Judd and elder half-sister Wynonna, Ashely is not a singer. But, she has graced the screen as an actress and captivated many hearts.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/6/Michael%20Caminella's%20biological%20daughter%20Ashley%20Judd-1701852124094.jpg"><p>The award-winning actress Ashley has 58 credits as an actress and is still active in the entertainment industry. Some of her movies and TV series include <i>A Dog's Way Home, Trafficked,</i> and so on.</p><p>Michael's biological daughter Ashley is currently single. She was previously married to Scottish racing driver <strong>Dario Franchitti</strong>. However, the former couple separated in 2013 after 12 years of togetherness.</p><h2>Michael Ciminella Dead Or Alive?</h2><p>Naomi Judd's ex-husband Michael Ciminella is still alive. Ciminella is doing well and is currently in his late 70s in terms of age. Many people believe Michael is dead as he shares the same name with his late father.</p><p>Ciminella's father Michael Ciminella Sr died at <a href=# rel=nofollow>the age of 83</a> in 1997. He passed away in Kentucky and was buried there.&nbsp;</p><h2>Michael Ciminella Net Worth</h2><p>Michael Ciminella boasts a fortune worth <strong>$3 Million</strong> as a net worth. He amassed this huge amount from his business ventures. Ciminella is the founder of Ashland Aluminum Co. Inc which specializes in the manufacturing of flat-rolled aluminum coils.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>In addition to this, Ciminella works as a marketing consultant, helping businesses with their advertising and promotion strategies. One can imagine him earning a hefty amount of money.</p><p>Michael's ex-wife Naomi Judd had an estimated net worth of <strong>$25 Million</strong> at the time of death. Similarly, his biological daughter Ashley has <strong>$14 Million</strong> worth of wealth.</p><h2>Is Michael Ciminella A Phillanthropist?</h2><p>Yes, Ashley Judd's biological father has been involved in philanthropic works. He is particularly interested in preserving the environment of eastern Kentucky. Michael has been an advocate of environmental protection and natural beauty preservation.</p><p>Similarly, Michael Ciminella has made charitable donations to many organizations. He has also supported causes such as cancer research, education, and the arts.</p><p>This shows that Ciminella is prudent with his finances. Naomi Judd's first husband uses his money for a good cause just like <a href=#><strong>Mayme Hatcher Johnson</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Michael Ciminella Is Described As A Feminist</h2><p>While Naomi Judd described her first husband as a horrible person, their daughter says he is a feminist. Yes, Ashely Judd mentioned Michael Ciminella as a feminist in her Instagram post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/6/Ashely%20Judd%20with%20her%20father%20Michael%20Ciminella%20and%20Nicholas%20Krishtof-1701852345558.jpg><p>In 2017, the <i>Double Jeopardy </i>actress wrote:</p><p>I am so proud to have joined the intrepid @nickkristof for a Facebook Live conversation at the @nytimes and to have been joined by my dad (who just happens to be a feminist, too).</p><h2>Michael Ciminella's Early Life</h2><p>Naomi Judd's first husband Michael Ciminella was born in 1945 in Louisville, Kentucky.

Following that, he went to Transylvania University and graduated with a master's in Business Administration. Michael then worked as a freelance remote sports producer at ESPN, CBS, ABC, and NBC Sports.&nbsp;</p><h2>Michael Ciminella Helped Ashley Judd In Congo</h2><p>Ashley Judd experienced a leg injury in a "freak accident" in February 2021. While grieving the loss of her mother Naomi Judd she stumbled over a fallen tree. Ashley suffered a severe injury that fractured her leg in four locations.</p><p>When Michael Ciminella got this news, he flew straight to South Africa.

Cimenella gave her courage, boosted her morale, and rubbed her foot.&nbsp;</p><p>Later the <i>Double Jeopardy </i>actress Judd thanked the hospital staff, her father, and all the well-wishers via instagram.
