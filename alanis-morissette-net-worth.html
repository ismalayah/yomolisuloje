She gained popularity for her emotive voice and was moderately successful in Canada during the early 90s. However, after relocating to Los Angeles, she released music that achieved commercial success.</p><p>Alanis continues to release music, with her 2020 album “Such Pretty Forks in the Road” being her latest. Her record sales have surpassed 75 million to date, earning her the title of “Queen of Alt-Rock Angst” in the music industry.</p><p>The majority of Alanis’ income was made during the mid-to-late 1990s, before the introduction of music streaming platforms like Napster. During this period, she sold approximately 60 million albums, which accounts for the majority of her career’s total sales.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_of_Alanis_Morissette>Early Life of Alanis Morissette</span></h2><p>Alanis Nadine Morissette was born on June 1st of 1974 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. She was raised in a Catholic family alongside two brothers by parents who were both teachers in a military school. Because of her parents’ work, she was forced to move often.</p><p>As a young girl, she lived in Germany for a period of three years. At the age of six, Alanis settled in Ottawa and started to play the piano. Dance lessons soon followed, and Morissette quickly developed a passion for music.</p><h2><span id=Alanis_Morissettes_Music_Career>Alanis Morissette’s Music Career</span></h2><p>Alanis Morissette started her music career in the late 80s, and her debut album “Alanis” was released in 1991 in Canada only. Her second album “Now Is the Time” was a commercial failure, leading to the termination of her record label contract. However, she bounced back with her internationally released album “Jagged Little Pill” in 1995, which sold more than 16 million copies in the US alone. She continued to release albums, collaborate with other artists, and tour throughout the years, with some albums receiving mixed reviews and poor sales. Her latest album “Such Pretty Forks in the Road” was released in 2020 and received positive reviews, selling 23,000 units within its first week.</p><h2><span id=Alanis_Morissette_Sells_Brentwood_Home_for_Over_5_Million>Alanis Morissette Sells Brentwood Home for Over $5 Million</span></h2><p>Alanis Morissette, the Grammy-winning musician, sold her Brentwood home in Los Angeles for $5.35 million in 2017. The Mediterranean-style property, which she bought in 1996 for $1.8 million, boasts six bedrooms and a swimming pool, spanning over 5,150 square feet on a half-acre lot. The property was initially listed for $5.495 million earlier in the year, but Morissette settled on a slightly lower final selling price.</p><h2><span id=Alanis_Morissettes_Former_Business_Manager_Sentenced_to_Six_Years_in_Prison>Alanis Morissette’s Former Business Manager Sentenced to Six Years in Prison</span></h2><p>Jonathan Schwartz, Alanis Morissette’s former business manager, was sued by the singer for stealing $5 million from her over a period of seven years. He ultimately admitted guilt and in 2017 was sentenced to serve six years in prison.</p><h2><span id=Alanis_Morisettes_Struggle_with_Depression_and_Mental_Health>Alanis Morisette’s Struggle with Depression and Mental Health</span></h2><p>Alanis Morisette has been open about her struggles with depression and mental health issues throughout her life. As a teenager, she suffered from eating disorders as a result of her depression, which continued into her early 20s. However, she sought help and began eating a healthy diet. In 2009, she participated in a marathon to raise awareness for eating disorders.</p><p>In a 2019 interview on “CBS This Morning,” Morisette discussed her battle with postpartum depression after the birth of her third child. She has been an advocate for mental health awareness and uses her platform to promote self-care and seeking help when needed.</p><h2><span id=Alanis_Morissettes_Relationships>Alanis Morissette’s Relationships</span></h2><p>In the early 90s, Alanis caused a media buzz after dating actor and comedian Dave Coulier. Another notable relationship came in the early 2000s, when Morissette began dating actor Ryan Reynold, a fellow Canadian. Although they became engaged in 2004, the couple called off their engagement in 2007.</p><p>In 2010, Alanis married a musician called Mario ‘Souleye’ Treadway. Over the course of their relationship, they have had three children together.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCty5qloqtdoryztdKsnK2slWK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falanis-morissette-net-worth.html&text=Alanis%20Morissette%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falanis-morissette-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falanis-morissette-net-worth.html&title=Alanis%20Morissette%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falanis-morissette-net-worth.html&title=Alanis%20Morissette%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falanis-morissette-net-worth.html&title=Alanis%20Morissette%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falanis-morissette-net-worth.html&description=Alanis%20Morissette%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lisa-faulkner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lisa Faulkner- Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Marrriage">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./john-legend-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Legend Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
