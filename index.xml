It is a heartbreaking love note to "Catherine,'' by a man who wants to make amends to his true north. Theresa, a divorced mother of one, is deeply touched by the message, and shares it with a columnist named Charlie (Robbie Coltrane), who of course lifts it for a column.</description></item><item><title>A Kang Variant In Ancient Egypt Will Reportedly Meet Apocalypse</title><link>/a-kang-variant-in-ancient-egypt-will-reportedly-meet-apocalypse.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/a-kang-variant-in-ancient-egypt-will-reportedly-meet-apocalypse.html</guid><description>Following the events of Loki, we know that Jonathan Majors is the big bad of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase Four, but we haven’t met Kang the Conqueror just yet.

Soon the bounds between reality and fantasy blur, and Ellie’s dreams become nightmares. Co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns (“1917”), Wright’s “Last Night in Soho” is funny and chaotic, slick and stylish, and falls apart in its confounding second half.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

For so much of American history, college has been sold as the key to the future. More and more, it’s a key that’s coming with baggage, including thousands of dollars in student loans. Competition for prestige among high-profile universities has led to rampant expansion. More programs means more facilities, means more students, means more attention, and so on.
