He is perhaps best known as a member of the Blue Collar Comedy troupe, which he co-created with fellow comedian Jeff Foxworthy in 2000, and featured stand-up talents Ron White and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Larry the Cable Guy</a>.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>The troupe embarked on a massive tour, Blue Collar Comedy Tour, which ran for six years and spawned three films, a satellite radio show, and a television series titled Blue Collar TV on The WB Network. In 2007, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a> reported that due to the breakout success of the Blue Collar Comedy tour and its various spinoffs, members of the troupe were among the wealthiest comedians of that year, all earning six or seven figures by performing the long-running circuit of stadium venues.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>During the height of his stand-up comedy career, it’s estimated that Engvall collected on average about $100,000 per gig. For reference, Engvall’s fellow Blue Comedy tour mates are similarly well-paid, with Foxworthy worth an estimated $100 million and Larry The Cable Guy garnering an $80 million net worth as of 2023. Remaining tour mate, Ron White, has a net worth of around $40 million.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, the troupe’s tour movie, Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie, grossed $600,000 at the domestic box office, while grossing almost $100 million in tours and DVD sales.&nbsp; Engvall went on to star in his own sitcom, The Bill Engvall Show, which ran for three seasons on TBS and notably starred Jennifer Lawrence in one of her first roles, before embarking on a television hosting stint. In 2011, he took over as the host of Lingo on the Game Show Network, though details around his salary for that show remain unknown.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Engvall continued his reality TV run with an appearance on the 17th season of Dancing with the Stars, which aired in 2013. While specific earnings are unknown, it was reported in 2023 that contestants on DWTS earn $50, 000 for their season-long appearance on the show, though that salary was likely lower in 2013.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>Engvall’s decades-long appearances on television have also included roles on shows like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Guy</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Last Man Standing</a>, the latter of which saw his co-star Tim Allen earn an estimated $235,000 per episode.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>Engvall’s pursuits also include the release of comedy albums, of which he has sold more than two million as of 2023. Across all eight of his comedy albums, Engvall is estimated to have earned around $2 million from copies sold. Engvall’s most successful comedy album, his 1996 debut titled Here’s Your Sign, went on to crack the Billboard Top 200, selling nearly 900,000 copies as of 2023.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Engvall’s earnings are also derived from real estate, after the comedian sold his Californian home in 2015 for an estimated $5.2 million. While the price is not yet known, Engvall’s newer home in Utah is located within the gated community of Glenwild, and ecompasses 8,500 square feet.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>As for cars, it’s been reported that Engvall owns a 1950 Chevrolet pickup truck and 1977 Volkswagen Van, while his wife, Gail, owns both an Aston Martin and a Mercedes Benz. In 2013, Engvall purchased a Tesla Model S.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZKeua15xKeer5mcocBuusStZLCnoqm1brXNZmlpamNk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-bill-engvalls-net-worth-in-2023.html&text=What%20is%20Bill%20Engvalls%20net%20worth%20in%202023%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-bill-engvalls-net-worth-in-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-bill-engvalls-net-worth-in-2023.html&title=What%20is%20Bill%20Engvalls%20net%20worth%20in%202023%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-bill-engvalls-net-worth-in-2023.html&title=What%20is%20Bill%20Engvalls%20net%20worth%20in%202023%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-bill-engvalls-net-worth-in-2023.html&title=What%20is%20Bill%20Engvalls%20net%20worth%20in%202023%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-bill-engvalls-net-worth-in-2023.html&description=What%20is%20Bill%20Engvalls%20net%20worth%20in%202023%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./name-the-smallest-ocean-in-the-world-the-arctic-ocean.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Name The Smallest Ocean In The world: TheArctic Ocean">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-untold-truth-of-katey-sagal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Untold Truth Of Katey Sagal">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
