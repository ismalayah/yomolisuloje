Launching his acting career in 1990 and consistently landing starring roles ever since, his acting prowess is well established. Yet his role in the Hollywood spotlight has been almost as varied as his on-screen gigs. Will Smith has played America’s sweetheart, bad boy, heartthrob, villain, and hero throughout his decades-long year career. Now with the recent bombshell about his and his wife<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Jada Pinkett Smith</a></strong>‘s six-year-long behind-the-scenes separation, he is revealed as playing the role of the ultimate secret keeper.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Yes, Will Smith is certainly a complicated character, so we decided to dig into his chart to see if his zodiac sign could shed any light on his personal life, loves, and oftentimes odd behavior and choices. Here’s what we found.</p><h2 id=h-will-smith-s-zodiac-sign-revealed data-injectable=false>Will Smith’s zodiac sign revealed</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=633 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Will Smith was born on September 25, making him fall under the air sign of Libra. Air signs are generally very creative and logical, and love a lot of freedom and movement in their lives and careers. Unfortunately, they can also be a bit flighty, often blowing whichever way the wind takes them and getting caught up in their own thoughts. They can be prone to anxiety and overthinking which can cause big reactions to seemingly small slights, as we have seen is well documented with Smith. Generally, air signs do well paired with a grounded earth sign, which Jada Pinkett Smith just happens to be, falling under the sign of Virgo.</p><p data-characters=723 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>Yet the problem many Libras tend to face can be seen in their pictorial representation, the sign of the scales. Libra’s feel a deep sense of justice and loyalty, they like things to be balanced and can often go above and beyond to ensure the scales of life are evened. This can mean putting others’ needs before their own or allowing their partner to determine the emotional vibe of the relationship. They can spend so much time trying to balance their partner’s feelings, they forget about their own. Many Libras report feeling that they don’t feel okay unless everyone around them is okay. Therefore they set out on the task of balancing the entire partnership, family, or even office environment.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>That’s a big task for one person. The magic in Libra is learning that true balance comes from allowing their own needs to be met as well as another person’s and finding the happy medium between. Otherwise, they can tend to overcorrect, again as we have seen with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Smith’s Oscar’s outburst</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Will Smith’s natal chart explored</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>Smith’s violent reaction is fairly unusual in some ways for Libras, as they are generally the ultimate peacemakers. They can be highly avoidant of conflict including difficult conversations with partners or friends, in order to attempt to keep the peace. The magic there is borrowing some fire from their Aries opposite, and learning that some conflict is necessary in creating true peace and balance in life and love. It seems Smith may have taken a little too much Aries fire medicine at the Oscars.</p><p data-characters=1127 data-current-count=1127 data-injectable=true>Although he and Jada’s recent<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> six-year separation announcement </a>has shocked fans, for a Libra, it really isn’t that unusual. Libra is also the sign of partnerships so they can be highly dedicated to maintaining a partnership no matter what. As mentioned, they can also tend toward avoidance so as opposed to having the tough conversation of “maybe we are no longer compatible” they will allow things like a six-year-long separation to just continue on. Virgo’s, as Jada Pinkett Smith is, are also highly dedicated to causes, which makes them a good pairing with Libra in many aspects but can make them equally avoidant of ending things. Virgo can feel very dedicated to a partnership or marriage and take it as a sign of failure if it doesn’t work out. While Libra can be very open and charismatic about many things, their partnership is not usually one of them, especially if their partner is less extroverted. Both they and Virgo can tend toward introversion and privacy in the relationship arena so it is possible that is also why the two kept a lid on their big announcement for so long.</p><p data-characters=702 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=false>While Will Smith’s behavior can sometimes make him come across as the ultimate man of mystery, his zodiac sign may help shine a little light on things. Libra’s are generally the more peaceful of the crew but as they are the sign of partnership, a lot of their behavior can depend on what is going on in their personal life. An unbalanced home scale can cause the generally charismatic, creative, and peace-loving air sign to act in ways that appear erratic, ungrounded, and over the top. Now, with the separation announcement, we may have a glimpse as to why, as of late, one of America’s favorite actors hasn’t been the Fresh Prince we’ve all previously known and loved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahmK1lmah6uLXLpWSspZmptbR52aibopmTYsCqs81o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-will-smiths-zodiac-sign.html&text=What%20is%20Will%20Smiths%20zodiac%20sign%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-will-smiths-zodiac-sign.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-will-smiths-zodiac-sign.html&title=What%20is%20Will%20Smiths%20zodiac%20sign%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-will-smiths-zodiac-sign.html&title=What%20is%20Will%20Smiths%20zodiac%20sign%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-will-smiths-zodiac-sign.html&title=What%20is%20Will%20Smiths%20zodiac%20sign%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-will-smiths-zodiac-sign.html&description=What%20is%20Will%20Smiths%20zodiac%20sign%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christian-juzang-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christian Juzang Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-tiktoks-viral-why-does-it-smell-like-pee-pee-and-poo-poo-in-here-trend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is TikToks viral Why Does it Smell Like Pee Pee and Poo Poo in Here trend?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
