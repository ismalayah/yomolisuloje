She premiered the video for her first single, “Anti-Hero.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Just a few short days later, following an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>, she announced the imminent premiere of the video for “Bejeweled.”</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=907 data-injectable=true>Talking to Fallon, Swift explained that her fans like to tease her for the cryptic clues she leaves in her songs and music videos, admitting, “I think we’ve just stopped pretending it’s accidental at this point.” She went on to announce that the video for “Bejeweled” would drop later that night (at midnight, naturally), adding that she wanted to make a video that was just for the fans that like “certain things” like “glitter, and easter eggs, and lots of little cameos.” Apparently there are so many references, she needed a PDF to keep track.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>The star-studded video is certainly a visual feast, and eagle-eyed Swifties have undoubtedly already got to work identifying all of Easter eggs hidden throughout the video. Having trouble finding them all? Fortunately, we’ve done the work for you.</p><h2 id=h-taylor-s-very-own-cinderella-story data-injectable=false>Taylor’s very own Cinderella Story</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.06.30-pm.png><p data-characters=589 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Immediately, the references to the classic fairytale, Cinderella, are obvious, with Swift playing the titular character (sorry, “House Wench Taylor”), the Haim sisters hamming it up as her wicked stepsisters, and Laura Dern killing it as the wicked stepmother. Taylor, dressed in rags, is being made to scrub the floors as the sisters gloat and scheme and hype each other up, while also insulting Taylor, who eventually asks, “Do we honestly have to do this entire verbal abuse thing every time you leave the house?” In Taylor’s world, Cinderella bites back.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>The video also stars Dita von Teese as Taylor’s “Fairy Goddess,” producer and pal Jack Antonoff as the Prince, and iconic makeup artist Pat McGrath as the Queen. Instead of a conventional makeover scene, Taylor performs in a giant martini glass alongside von Teese, looking absolutely stunning and like she’s having the time of her life. She adds another twist to the classic fairy tale by ghosting Prince Jack at the end after he finally proposed to her. Hit the road, Jack.</p><h2 id=h-haim-s-hungover-song data-injectable=false>Haim’s “Hungover” song</h2><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>On their way out the door, the Haim sisters can be heard singing, “I’m gonna be hungover, I’m gonna drink a bunch of different drinks, and I’m gonna be hungover.” This is a reference to a TikTok the band posted that went viral back in March of the sisters singing those words on their way to the Academy Awards. Clearly it’s now their theme song.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true><a title=@haimtheband href=#>@haimtheband</a><p>pray for us 🙂</p><a title="♬ Hungover - haimtheband" href=#>♬ Hungover – haimtheband</a></figure><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>All of the folklore references</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.13.19-pm.png><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>“You’ve been exiled here” and “Have fun being exiled, stinky,” are spoken by Laura Dern and Alana Haim’s characters to House Wench Taylor respectively, and they’re obviously references to the song “exile” featuring Bon Iver off 2020’s folklore, as is the stopwatch Taylor is seen holding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-7.00.34-pm.png><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>Eagle-eyed fans have also noticed that the cabin Taylor used to record Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions can be seen at the end of the video. Since folklore isn’t in need of a Taylor’s Version update, these references are probably just cute nods to an excellent album, albeit one with similar themes of mythology and folktales.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>An “End Game” throwback?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.21.44-pm.png><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>I don’t think this means anything; I just think Taylor likes sparkly black hoodies.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-design.png><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>Taylor’s princess outfit at the end of the video is heavily influenced by Sofia Coppola’s 2006 film, Marie Antoinette, which took the rococo style popular during Antoinette’s life and added a little spice.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>All of the Speak Now references</strong></h2><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>Perhaps most exciting were all of the references to Swift’s third studio album, Speak Now, which was released in 2010 and has yet to receive the Taylor’s Version treatment. In fact, the “Bejeweled” video was released on Speak Now‘s 12th anniversary.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>To start, throughout the first scene with Taylor as Cinderella, an instrumental version of “Enchanted” can be heard in the background. Not only does it suit the story being told in the video, but it’s the ninth track off Speak Now. During this scene, at one point Dern’s character tells Taylor to “Speak not!” rather than speak now. Cute.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>Later, as Taylor is riding in the elevator, she presses a light purple button with the number “3” on it. Speak Now was her third album and is associated with the color purple because of Taylor’s dress and the text on the album cover. The buttons correspond to the colors her other albums are associated with and their release order—Red and Red (Taylor’s Version) at four and 11, Fearless and Fearless (Taylor’s Version) at two and 10 respectively, etc.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.06.17-pm.png><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>Just before the opulent and awe-inspiring finale, we see that the elevator has travelled to the 13th floor, represented by a dark purple colour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.33.42-pm.png><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>The giant clock Taylor sits on during the spectacular final scene is set to 3 o’clock.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-8.46.30-pm.png><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>At the very end of the video, the camera pans out from Taylor on the balcony of her castle surveying her kingdom and shows three dragons—presumably the Haim sisters transformed—flying around as an instrumental version of “Long Live” plays in the background. In case you need a refresher, “Long Live” contains the line, “I’ve had the time of my life fighting dragons with you.” Very fitting music for Taylor’s twisted Cinderella story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.41.57-pm.png><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=false>I’m only an amateur Swiftologist, but if you ask me, the sheer number of Speak Now references in this music video suggests that like many (okay, especially me) hoped, it will be the next album to receive the Taylor’s Version treatment. I’m fully prepared to eat my words if I’m wrong, but I don’t think I am. Taylor, please don’t let me down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46ao6VlpJ2ybrHArKueql2atKi%2FjLCcZpufqrmlecWipZ1lmaN6ta3YpaarZaOstqfA0maZnqKVrLKtscNmpK6rmZh6t7XDnqZo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fall-the-easter-eggs-we-could-find-in-taylor-swifts-bejeweled-music-video.html&text=All%20the%20Easter%20eggs%20we%20could%20find%20in%20Taylor%20Swifts%20Bejeweled%20music%20video&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-the-easter-eggs-we-could-find-in-taylor-swifts-bejeweled-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-easter-eggs-we-could-find-in-taylor-swifts-bejeweled-music-video.html&title=All%20the%20Easter%20eggs%20we%20could%20find%20in%20Taylor%20Swifts%20Bejeweled%20music%20video" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fall-the-easter-eggs-we-could-find-in-taylor-swifts-bejeweled-music-video.html&title=All%20the%20Easter%20eggs%20we%20could%20find%20in%20Taylor%20Swifts%20Bejeweled%20music%20video" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-easter-eggs-we-could-find-in-taylor-swifts-bejeweled-music-video.html&title=All%20the%20Easter%20eggs%20we%20could%20find%20in%20Taylor%20Swifts%20Bejeweled%20music%20video" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-the-easter-eggs-we-could-find-in-taylor-swifts-bejeweled-music-video.html&description=All%20the%20Easter%20eggs%20we%20could%20find%20in%20Taylor%20Swifts%20Bejeweled%20music%20video" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./keith-jefferson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keith Jefferson movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-are-cooper-rushs-parents-matthew-rush-and-frances-rush.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Cooper Rushs Parents Matthew Rush And Frances Rush?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
