From musicians to actors and TV personalities, so many celebrities have departed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in the last few decades</a> that it’s starting to feel personal (i.e. Betty White). Some of the world’s most unforgettable faces have died from natural causes, illnesses, accidents, and other unfortunate occurrences, but only a handful have passed on under some rather bizarre circumstances.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>From the outrageous tale of how Elvis Presley “died on the toilet” to the age-old scandal of Marilyn Monroe’s staged suicide, not all deaths are black and white, and these are some of the most prominent head-scratchers of our time.</p><h3 id=h-michael-jackson data-injectable=false>Michael Jackson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Michael-Jackson.jpg><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Dubbed the “King of Pop” and one of history’s most influential singer-songwriter-dancer-choreographers, Michael Jackson originated as the co-lead singer (along with Jermaine) of the Jackson 5, then later pursued a solo career to release hits such as “Billie Jean,” Thriller,” “Bad,” “Man in the Mirror,” and “Smooth Criminal.”</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>In June 2009, Jackson died from cardiac arrest, caused by a propofol and benzodiazepine overdose. His personal physician, Conrad Murray, later came under fire for prescribing hefty doses of propofol,&nbsp;lorazepam, and&nbsp;midazolam, which conspiracy theories believed to be intentional so as to deliberately murder him. Another internet theory suggests that Jackson faked his own death to evade financial trouble.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Sonny Bono</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Getty-Images-Cher-and-Sonny-Bono.jpg><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>Singer, songwriter, actor, and former mayor of Palm Springs, California, Sonny Bono rose to prominence after partnering with his second wife Cher as the musical duo Sonny & Cher. In total, Bono was married four times — to Donna Rankin, Cherilyn Sarkisian (Cher), Susie Coelho, and Mary Whitaker. He has three children in total, through Rankin and Whitaker.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>Bono died in January 1998 after a freak skiing accident wherein he veered off course and hit a tree in South Lake Tahoe, California. Cher gave a eulogy at Sonny’s funeral, at Mary’s request.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Steve Irwin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Getty-Images-Steve-Irwin.jpg><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Australian zookeeper, conservationist, and television personality Steve Irwin had encountered hundreds of crocodiles throughout his career as a wildlife educator. Irwin co-hosted The Crocodile Hunter with his wife Terri, and had a one-time feature film role in The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>Irwin died in September 2006 after a short-tailed stingray barb pierced his chest and penetrated his&nbsp;thoracic wall, causing massive trauma to his heart. At the time, he was in&nbsp;Port Douglas, Queensland, filming the documentary series Ocean’s Deadliest.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>John Denver</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Getty-Images-John-Denver.jpg><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>John Denver was a jack-of-all trades; a guitarist, singer, composer, and environmentalist who popularized acoustic folk music during the 1970s. In the American West, Denver is considered to be a cultural icon. In his lengthy career, Denver produced over 300 songs, including his signature ones, “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” “Poems, Prayers & Promises,” and “Rocky Mountain High,” among others.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>In October 1997, while piloting his homebuilt aircraft, Denver crashed into the Monterey Bay&nbsp;near&nbsp;Pacific Grove, California, during a series of touch-and-go landings. At the time of the crash, Denver was not legally permitted to fly, following several arrests for drunk driving.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Elvis Presley</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Getty-Images-Elvis-Presley.jpg><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Michael Jackson is the King of Pop, but Elvis Presley is the King of Rock and Roll. Largely regarded as one of the most culturally influential figures of the 20th century, the actor and singer’s most famous films included Jailhouse Rock, Blue Hawaii, and&nbsp;Viva Las Vegas, and his most famous songs were “Hound Dog,” “Jailhouse Rock,” and “A Big Hunk o’ Love.” Presley also had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a twin brother</a>.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>In the final months before his eventual death in August 1977, Presley was described by journalists as “grossly overweight” and had turned to drugs and alcohol, barely managing to get through his abbreviated concerts sober. On the afternoon of August 16, Presley was found unresponsive on the bathroom floor. His death was thought to involve a reaction to&nbsp;codeine&nbsp;and an attempt to move his bowels, hence the summary that he “died on the toilet.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Marilyn Monroe</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Marilyn-Monroe.jpg><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>The original blonde bombshell, Marilyn Monroe was one of the most popular sex symbols of the ’50s and ’60s. Towards the end of her career, Monroe was involved in controversy with Fox after the studio blamed her for the failure of Something’s Got to Give, then proceeded to spread negative publicity about her, alleging that she was mentally disturbed.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Monroe was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her death</a> wasn’t as straightforward as a cut-and-print suicide. She passed away on the evening of August 4, 1962, and her cause of death was identified as acute barbiturate poisoning. The possibility of an accidental overdose was ruled out in her toxicology report, so her demise was thought by some to be orchestrated by Robert Kennedy&nbsp;to hide her involvement with John F. Kennedy.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Tupac Shakur</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Getty-Images-Tupac.jpg><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>Considered to be one of the most influential rappers of all time, Tupac Shakur (known mononymously as Tupac), is among the best-selling musicians. Through his music, Tupac became a symbol of activism against inequality, often addressing social issues in his songs. Some of his most popular tracks include “Keep Ya Head Up,” “Changes,” and “California Love.” Tupac was scheduled to audition for Jedi Master&nbsp;Mace Windu&nbsp;to appear in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace prior to his death, but the role ultimately went to Samuel L. Jackson.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>In September 1996, Tupac was out in Las Vegas, Nevada, celebrating his business partner Tracy Danielle Robinson’s birthday. After the festivities, Tupac was on the way to Suge Knight’s Death Row nightclub when a white Cadillac&nbsp;pulled beside his black sedan at a stop light and fired rapidly into the passenger side, fatally injuring him. He was placed on life support in the ICU, but ultimately died from internal bleeding.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Natalie Wood</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Getty-Images-Natalie-Wood.jpg><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Landing her starring role in Miracle on 34th Street&nbsp;at just eight years old, Natalie Woods kickstarted a career that later included roles in the coming-of-age romantic drama Rebel Without a Cause and the musical film Gypsy. In July 2018, Wood’s sister&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lana&nbsp;said</a> that Natalie was raped as a teenager during an audition that “went on for hours.”</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>During the making of Brainstorm, Wood was said to have died under mysterious circumstances. She had drowned while on a weekend boat trip to&nbsp;Santa Catalina Island&nbsp;with her then-husband Robert Wagner. Wood had been with Wagner, her Brainstorm co-star Christopher Walken, and the captain of Wagner’s boat, Dennis Davern, at the time of the alleged accident. The autopsy later revealed that Wood had suffered bruises on her body and arms, as well as an abrasion on her left cheek.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Bruce Lee</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Getty-Images-Bruce-Lee.jpg><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>Chinese-American Bruce Lee was a martial artist, actor, and the founder of the hybrid martial arts philosophy&nbsp;Jeet Kune Do. In his lifetime, Lee promoted Hong Kong action cinema, paved the way for modern-day mixed martial arts, and helped to bridge the gap between the East and the West. Additionally, Lee is often credited with singlehandedly changing the way that Chinese people are represented in the American entertainment industry.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>In May 1973, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lee collapsed</a> during an ADR&nbsp;session for&nbsp;one of his most famous films, Enter the Dragon. He was diagnosed&nbsp;with cerebral edema, but the doctors were able to reduce the swelling in his brain. In July that same year, Lee attended dinner with Enter the Dragon producer Raymond Chow and Taiwanese actress Betty Ting Pei. After complaining of a headache, Ting gave him the painkiller&nbsp;Equagesic,&nbsp;which caused an allergic reaction.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>David Carradine</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Getty-Images-David-Carradine.jpg><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>Actor and musician David Carradine rose to prominence for portraying the titular character in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill franchise. He gained further recognition through his role as Kwai Chang Caine in the 1970s television series&nbsp;Kung Fu, and his stint performing in two Martin Scorsese films, Boxcar Bertha&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mean Streets. For the biopic Bound for Glory, Carradine earned a Golden Globe&nbsp;nomination for&nbsp;Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>In June 2009, while in Thailand to shoot on location for Stretch, Carradine was found dead in his hotel room closet in central Bangkok. After he was found with a rope tied to both his neck and his genitals, police came to the conclusion that Carradine’s death was caused by accidental suffocation due to&nbsp;auto-erotic asphyxiation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMamdmpZ%2BowW6uyLOYq6qVYrCmuMSbqaKsqWKxpq3Toapo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-most-bizarre-celebrity-deaths.html&text=The%2010%20most%20bizarre%20celebrity%20deaths&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-most-bizarre-celebrity-deaths.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-most-bizarre-celebrity-deaths.html&title=The%2010%20most%20bizarre%20celebrity%20deaths" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-10-most-bizarre-celebrity-deaths.html&title=The%2010%20most%20bizarre%20celebrity%20deaths" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-most-bizarre-celebrity-deaths.html&title=The%2010%20most%20bizarre%20celebrity%20deaths" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-most-bizarre-celebrity-deaths.html&description=The%2010%20most%20bizarre%20celebrity%20deaths" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tinubu-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tinubu Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-rhony-star-brynn-whitfields-ethnicity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is RHONY star Brynn Whitfields ethnicity?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
