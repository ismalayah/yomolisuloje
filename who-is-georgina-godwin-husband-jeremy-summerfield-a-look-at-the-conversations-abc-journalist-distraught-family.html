During her childhood, the country of Zimbabwe was still a British colony and went by the name Rhodesia.</p><p>Georgina grew up with her brother Peter Godwin, sister Jain, and family members in Rhodesia. There she attended St. George’s College. Her older sister Jain and her fiance were killed when their car hit an army ambush.</p><p>Peter Godwin’s sister, Georgina, has worked as a journalist, podcaster, and broadcast presenter in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia until 2001) and the United Kingdom.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Georgina Godwin Was Married To Jeremy Summerfield">Georgina Godwin Was Married To Jeremy Summerfield</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="The Secret Life Of Georgina: Conversation With ABC">The Secret Life Of Georgina: Conversation With ABC</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Meet Georgina Godwin’s Daughter Xanthe">Meet Georgina Godwin’s Daughter Xanthe</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Georgina Godwin Partner">Georgina Godwin Partner</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=georgina-godwin-was-married-to-jeremy-summerfield></span>Georgina Godwin Was Married To Jeremy Summerfield<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Georgina Godwin and Jeremy Summerfield tied the knot in Zimbabwe in March of 1997. Jeremy&nbsp;studied&nbsp;at St. Georges, the same school Godwin’s siblings attended. There they formed a group of Bright Young Thing with Manuel Bagorro.</p><p>The couple might have started dating while they were in school. After being in relation for a few years, the couple conducted a wedding ceremony in Zimbabwe in 1997.</p><p>After a few years of marriage, the pair had a daughter, Xanthe. Georgian later planned to leave Zimbabwe for London with her baby daughter Xanthe and her husband, Jeremy.</p><p>After the couple moved to London, Georgian’s life partner, Jeremy Summerfield, decided he was gay and moved out, leaving Georgina alone with their small daughter, Xanthe.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-secret-life-of-georgina-conversation-with-abc></span>The Secret Life Of Georgina: Conversation With ABC<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Georgina Godwin recently spoke with a journalist from ABC about her new book The Eye Of The Beholder, a dramatic story of lies, trust, and love. During the&nbsp;discussion, she recalls growing up in Zimbabwe, working as a journo under Mugabe’s regime, and learning of her father’s long-held secret.</p><p>The journalist’s father, George Godwin, was an engineer of Polish Jewish ancestry. However, Georgina and her brother Peter were shocked when they discovered their parents were not entirely honest with them.</p><p>Her father, George Godwin, was living a lie all those years. She later discovered that her father’s real name was Kazimierz Jerzy Goldfarb, and he was a descendent of a Jewish family in Poland.</p><p>George later revealed that he hid his identity so Georgina and her brother could live a safe life. But, he added during 1939, Jews were an endangered minority and the target of ethnic cleansing.</p><p>Her mother, Helena, came from four generations of Anglican churchmen. She worked as a doctor at her medical clinic.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-georgina-godwins-daughter-xanthe></span>Meet Georgina Godwin’s Daughter Xanthe<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Xanthe Summerfield, the daughter of Georgina Godwin, is a highly versatile, eager, and hardworking young writer and performer. She attended St Marylebone School for Performing Arts on a drama scholarship from 2011-2018.</p><p>Xanthe is currently studying writing for performance at the Central School of Speech and Drama, a part of the University of London. She has been doing stand-up comedies and has made her appearances in lead roles in dramas.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=georgina-godwin-partner></span>Georgina Godwin Partner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The broadcast journalist Georgina was previously married to Jeremy Summerfield, who later came out as gay and left her. Godwin is very private and has not shared much about her current partner.</p><p>However, she has appeared on her Instagram profile with a man who might be her partner on many occasions. In one particular&nbsp;post, she is posing for a mirror selfie with The Man, trying new clothes from Nearly New Cashmere. Many people commented on the post mentioning he is Georgina’s current life partner of Georgina, to which she has not commented.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ygnKiql567onnGqJuwoZ5itba%2FwZqlnWWamr%2Bmudhmqq6lnZq%2Fp7XEpZtmmV2hvLC3jJqrZqyYmnqku82vnKurkam2sLrSZpibm12fvLa%2BzZqjoqukYrGqv9OrmK6fmKl6p63MoqOyZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-georgina-godwin-husband-jeremy-summerfield-a-look-at-the-conversations-abc-journalist-distraught-family.html&text=Who%20Is%20Georgina%20Godwin%20Husband%20Jeremy%20Summerfield%3f%20A%20Look%20At%20The%20Conversations%20ABC%20Journalist%20Distra&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-georgina-godwin-husband-jeremy-summerfield-a-look-at-the-conversations-abc-journalist-distraught-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-georgina-godwin-husband-jeremy-summerfield-a-look-at-the-conversations-abc-journalist-distraught-family.html&title=Who%20Is%20Georgina%20Godwin%20Husband%20Jeremy%20Summerfield%3f%20A%20Look%20At%20The%20Conversations%20ABC%20Journalist%20Distra" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-georgina-godwin-husband-jeremy-summerfield-a-look-at-the-conversations-abc-journalist-distraught-family.html&title=Who%20Is%20Georgina%20Godwin%20Husband%20Jeremy%20Summerfield%3f%20A%20Look%20At%20The%20Conversations%20ABC%20Journalist%20Distra" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-georgina-godwin-husband-jeremy-summerfield-a-look-at-the-conversations-abc-journalist-distraught-family.html&title=Who%20Is%20Georgina%20Godwin%20Husband%20Jeremy%20Summerfield%3f%20A%20Look%20At%20The%20Conversations%20ABC%20Journalist%20Distra" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-georgina-godwin-husband-jeremy-summerfield-a-look-at-the-conversations-abc-journalist-distraught-family.html&description=Who%20Is%20Georgina%20Godwin%20Husband%20Jeremy%20Summerfield%3f%20A%20Look%20At%20The%20Conversations%20ABC%20Journalist%20Distra" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./charles-stanley-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charles Stanley Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./theres-no-way-i-want-to-be-turned-blue-ahsoka-wouldve-been-very-different-if-disney-convinced-a-marvel-superstar-worth-45m-to-play-thrawn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Theres no way I want to be turned blue: Ahsoka wouldve been very different if Disn">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
