When William and Anna both start feeling and acting on their affections for one another, things start to go south. Once they start dating, this sets off a string of deliberate lies and hurried meet-ups between the two.</p><p>Based on Josephine Hart’s book “Damage,” “Obsession” was written by Morgan Lloyd Malcolm and Benji Walters. The show focuses on William and Anna’s illicit connection as well as the measures they take to maintain it and keep it a secret. Here are a few suggestions that I think you would appreciate if you liked the show’s plot. The majority of these ‘Obsession’-inspired shows are available to stream on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, Amazon Prime, or Hulu.</p><h3>A Teacher (2020)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/A-Teacher-Kate-Mara-and-Nick-Robinson-1024x683-1.jpg alt="shows like sexlife and 365 days,shows like sexlife on netflix,shows about obsession and stalking,shows similar to sexlife,shows about stalkers on netflix,what is the best series on netflix currently,series about obsession and stalking on netflix,binge worthy shows on netflix,shows like sex/life and 365 days,shows like sex/life on netflix,shows similar to sex/life,binge-worthy shows on netflix,obsession netflix series,obsession shows on netflix,best obsession series on netflix,shows on netflix like bridgerton,shows like you on netflix" width=512 height=342 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The central characters of “A Teacher” are English teacher Claire (Kate Mara) and Eric (Nick Robinson), a popular student in her class. At first, their chemistry seems typical, but things quickly get out of hand when Eric expresses interest in Claire, who is unhappy with her marriage to her college sweetheart. Although though their communication was initially restricted to chatting to one other about their struggles, the two quickly began an affair that threatened to wreck their lives.</p><p>Hannah Fidell’s “A Teacher” is perhaps the most similar to “Obsession” in terms of power dynamics between Clarie and Eric and their pronounced age disparity.</p><h3>Behind Her Eyes (2021)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Behind-Her-Eyes_Netflix-2-1.jpg alt="shows like sexlife and 365 days,shows like sexlife on netflix,shows about obsession and stalking,shows similar to sexlife,shows about stalkers on netflix,what is the best series on netflix currently,series about obsession and stalking on netflix,binge worthy shows on netflix,shows like sex/life and 365 days,shows like sex/life on netflix,shows similar to sex/life,binge-worthy shows on netflix,obsession netflix series,obsession shows on netflix,best obsession series on netflix,shows on netflix like bridgerton,shows like you on netflix" width=450 height=325 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Steve Lightfoot film “Beyond Her Eyes” tells the tale of single mother Louise Barnsley (Simona Brown), who has an affair with her married boss Dr. David Ferguson (Tom Bateman). Even worse, Louise develops a friendship with Adele, David’s wife (Eve Hewson). Although the situation may appear to be a straightforward love triangle, the true story is full of intrigue and has a faint tinge of the paranormal.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uef8f63d4ca03cc6639699026f075dd24><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>5 Most Iconic And Remarkable Netflix Shows Everyone Must Watch</span></a><p>This paranormal psychological thriller series is based on Sarah Pinborough’s 2017 book of the same name. Viewers will be reminded of William and Anna’s obsessive attachment with each other despite only having met once in “Obsession” by the characters in “Behind Her Eyes”‘ love triangle.</p><h3></h3><h3>Dark Desire (2020-2022)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dark-desire-02.jpg alt="shows like sexlife and 365 days,shows like sexlife on netflix,shows about obsession and stalking,shows similar to sexlife,shows about stalkers on netflix,what is the best series on netflix currently,series about obsession and stalking on netflix,binge worthy shows on netflix,shows like sex/life and 365 days,shows like sex/life on netflix,shows similar to sex/life,binge-worthy shows on netflix,obsession netflix series,obsession shows on netflix,best obsession series on netflix,shows on netflix like bridgerton,shows like you on netflix" width=512 height=341 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Leticia López Margalli’s “Dark Lust” is a mystery and sex-filled story from start to finish. The narrative centres on Alma Solares (Maite Perroni), a respected attorney and college lecturer who is dissatisfied with her marriage. She meets the dashing Dario Guerra (Alejandro Speitzer) while visiting a friend and eventually has an affair with him. Dario, however, turns out to be a new student in the class she instructs, something she was unaware of. Hence, what initially began as a one-time event for Alma quickly develops into a game of lies and poses a threat to reveal many more secrets than just Alma’s.</p><p>Despite its emphasis on extramarital relationships, the romance drama series is a tangled web of lies and desire that ensnares more than just Alma and Dario. No less interesting than watching William and Anna conceal their love in “Obsession” are the hoop-jumpers the protagonists in “Dark Desire” had to leap through to keep everything a secret.</p><h3>Devotion, a Story of Love and Desire (2022)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Devotion-a-Story-of-Love-and-Desire.jpg alt="shows like sexlife and 365 days,shows like sexlife on netflix,shows about obsession and stalking,shows similar to sexlife,shows about stalkers on netflix,what is the best series on netflix currently,series about obsession and stalking on netflix,binge worthy shows on netflix,shows like sex/life and 365 days,shows like sex/life on netflix,shows similar to sex/life,binge-worthy shows on netflix,obsession netflix series,obsession shows on netflix,best obsession series on netflix,shows on netflix like bridgerton,shows like you on netflix" width=512 height=341 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>From the bestselling 2019 book Fedeltà by Marco Missiroli comes “Devotion, a Tale of Love and Passion.” It centres on the happily married couple Carlo (Michele Riondino), a professor and novelist at a university, and Margharita (Lucrezia Guidone), a real estate agent. But, their union is quickly called into doubt when Margharita witnesses Carlo consoling Sofia (Carolina Sala), one of his pupils, in a lavatory.</p><p>Carlo and Margharita had been married for a very long period, much like William and Ingrid in “Obsession,” but one bad incident destroys everything for both of them and raises questions about Carlo’s loyalty throughout their marriage.</p><h3></h3><h3>Fishbowl Wives (2022)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fishbowl-Wives.jpg alt="shows like sexlife and 365 days,shows like sexlife on netflix,shows about obsession and stalking,shows similar to sexlife,shows about stalkers on netflix,what is the best series on netflix currently,series about obsession and stalking on netflix,binge worthy shows on netflix,shows like sex/life and 365 days,shows like sex/life on netflix,shows similar to sex/life,binge-worthy shows on netflix,obsession netflix series,obsession shows on netflix,best obsession series on netflix,shows on netflix like bridgerton,shows like you on netflix" width=512 height=288 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In ‘Fishbowl Wives’, Ryoko Shinohara plays Sakura Hiraga, a woman with a seemingly ideal marriage. Her husband owns a hair shop, and they share a lavish penthouse apartment with all they could want. All of it, however, is a front for the daily emotional and physical abuse Sakura receives from her husband. She finds comfort in the embrace of another man since she is unable to escape her predicament.</p><p>The series, which is based on the manga “Kingyo Tsuma” by Kurosawa R, also examines five other women who engage in extramarital affairs and their motivations for doing so, and how this information is weaved into Sakura’s primary plot. Though different from the motivations in “Obsession,” the themes of domestic violence, bullying, and neglect that drive these six women to cheat on their spouses will offer viewers a fresh way of seeing illicit relationships. The tastefully staged <a href=#>sex scenes</a> contribute to the plot and aren’t merely there for effect.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u0996356332a3c990c92394c9fd6dce04><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Best Shows On Netflix Right Now - January 2023</span></a><h3></h3><h3>Playing with Fire (2019-)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Playing-With-Fire.jpg alt="shows like sexlife and 365 days,shows like sexlife on netflix,shows about obsession and stalking,shows similar to sexlife,shows about stalkers on netflix,what is the best series on netflix currently,series about obsession and stalking on netflix,binge worthy shows on netflix,shows like sex/life and 365 days,shows like sex/life on netflix,shows similar to sex/life,binge-worthy shows on netflix,obsession netflix series,obsession shows on netflix,best obsession series on netflix,shows on netflix like bridgerton,shows like you on netflix" width=512 height=397 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In “Playing with Fire,” Jason Day plays Fabrizio, a charming man who just cares about himself and will stop at nothing to find <a href=#>pleasure</a>. Fabrizio, however, is unable to identify the feelings that others may have for him as he engages in an affair with three separate women. Due to their lack of comprehension, the three women quickly descend into violence as they attempt to keep Fabrizio as their only man by any means necessary, including hurting him and sabotaging one another. The situation for the Colombian Casanova isn’t looking good, especially with the involvement of two of the women’s husbands.</p><p>Produced by Telemundo International Studios and Globo is “Playing with Fire.” It is based on George Moura’s Brazilian miniseries “Amores Roubados.” The series shows the terrible results of unrestrained sexual urges, especially in situations and relationships that are illegal, as well as the risks of becoming so fixated on someone that you lose sight of reality, much like in the movie “Obsession.”</p><h3>Sex/Life (2021-2023)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FireShot-Capture-010-sexlife.jpg-1536_C3_97864-static.filmvandaag.nl_-e1624286943360.jpg alt="shows like sexlife and 365 days,shows like sexlife on netflix,shows about obsession and stalking,shows similar to sexlife,shows about stalkers on netflix,what is the best series on netflix currently,series about obsession and stalking on netflix,binge worthy shows on netflix,shows like sex/life and 365 days,shows like sex/life on netflix,shows similar to sex/life,binge-worthy shows on netflix,obsession netflix series,obsession shows on netflix,best obsession series on netflix,shows on netflix like bridgerton,shows like you on netflix" width=589 height=299 sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Billie Connelly (Sarah Shahi), a suburban housewife and mother in Connecticut with a kind and understanding husband, is the main character in “Sex/Life.” Even while she is content, she can’t help but wonder if her current state of tranquilly and routine represents what true <a href=#>happiness</a> looks like for her. Billie frequently recalls her single existence, which was characterised by wild parties and sex. When she runs into Brad (Adam Demos), her ex-boyfriend, these emotions hit an all-time high, and Billie immediately feels ten years younger.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u933fa9918d6344e06fd528831d22fe50><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>5 Most Iconic And Remarkable Netflix Shows Everyone Must Watch</span></a><p>Fans of “Obsession” will like the show’s depiction of the complexities of sexuality and jealousy, the forbidden relationship between numerous characters, and its unique sequences of lovemaking. It was created by Stacy Rukeyser.</p><h3></h3><h3>The Affair (2014-2019)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rs_1024x759-151015081652-1024.the-affair-season-2.ch_.101515.jpg alt="shows like sexlife and 365 days,shows like sexlife on netflix,shows about obsession and stalking,shows similar to sexlife,shows about stalkers on netflix,what is the best series on netflix currently,series about obsession and stalking on netflix,binge worthy shows on netflix,shows like sex/life and 365 days,shows like sex/life on netflix,shows similar to sex/life,binge-worthy shows on netflix,obsession netflix series,obsession shows on netflix,best obsession series on netflix,shows on netflix like bridgerton,shows like you on netflix" width=405 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The adulterous relationship between Noah Solloway (Dominic West) and Alison Bailey (Ruth Wilson) and its effects on their lives over a number of years are explored in the film “The Affair,” which was created by Sarah Treem and Hagai Levi. The narrative uses a distinctive point of view structure in which the affair is depicted from Noah’s and Alison’s perspectives, respectively. Due to their disparate personalities and lifestyles, this frequently results in a radically different memory of the same occurrences.</p><p>The movie “The Affair” depicts what happens to those who are <a href=#>caught cheating</a>, particularly when they were leading completely normal lives before to their course of action. Both Noah and William are contentedly married, yet they each made a decision that cost them all they had worked so hard to achieve.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="shows like sexlife and 365 days,shows like sexlife on netflix,shows about obsession and stalking,shows similar to sexlife,shows about stalkers on netflix,what is the best series on netflix currently,series about obsession and stalking on netflix,binge worthy shows on netflix,shows like sex/life and 365 days,shows like sex/life on netflix,shows similar to sex/life,binge-worthy shows on netflix,obsession netflix series,obsession shows on netflix,best obsession series on netflix,shows on netflix like bridgerton,shows like you on netflix" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
